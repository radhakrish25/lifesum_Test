1. Download conf.js and trackWeight.js files in one folder.
2. Install firefox browser on your Linux/Unix PC
3. Install protractor on your Linux/Unix PC using this guide: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial
4. Execute test using this command: "protractor conf.js"

/usr/local/bin



2. Which software/ framework did you choose in task#1 and why ? what are its main advantages in your opinion?

Protractor + jasmine + some additional modules for better reporting. It will give more flexibility than just standalone Selenium, because the solution here is written using Angular.js and it is much better to use protractor + jasmine for these kind of projects. 

In addition it is very simple to integrate it with CI using jenkins.
